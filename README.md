# Mini Python Project

## Madlibs

A traditonal game played by filling in the blanks in a sentence

I am going to recreate this game with python using
### String Concatenation (aka how to put strings together)

Suppose we wanted to create a string that says "Welcome to ______"
place = "Lagos"

## print("Welcome to " + place)
## print("Welcome to {}".format(place))
## print(f"Welcome to {place}")
